# Angora: A free finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic simulation package

*Angora* is a free, open-source software package that computes numerical solutions to electromagnetic radiation and scattering problems. It is based on the [finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain), which is one of the most popular approaches for solving Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics. It has been developed by [Ilker R. Capoglu](mailto:capoglu@angorafdtd.org) and [Di Zhang](mailto:dizhang2016@u.northwestern.edu), and is currently maintained by Aya Eid and Patrick (Yuanzhe) Su. <dfn>Angora</dfn> has been written mostly in C++, with a few external C functions.

## Main features of Angora

* Flexible and user-friendly configuration via text-based configuration files.

*   An automatic build and install mechanism for the GNU/Linux operating system.
*   **Full parallelizability** in three dimensions, based on the Message Passing Interface ([MPI](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/)) library.
*   Support for **planar multilayered spaces.**
    *   Total-field/scattered-field (TF/SF) plane-wave source.
    *   Phasor-domain near-field-to-far-field transformation (NFFFT).
*   Complex optical beams (focused beam, Hermite-Gaussian beam)
*   Convolution perfectly-matched layer (**CPML**) absorbing boundaries.
*   Support for **[HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)**, a portable file storage format.
*   Support for **dispersive media** with Drude/Lorentz pole pairs.
*   Support for external inputs of materials and shapes.
*   Field-value recording (2D, 1D, single point) and movie generation.
*   Generation of **random** permittivity, permeability, conductivity profiles.
*   Numerical **optical imaging** simulation.
